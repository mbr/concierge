docker-pygen
============

An incomplete clone (lacking notifications) of [jwilder/docker-gen]
(https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen), written in Python and leveraging
[jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org).

For production I recommend `docker-gen` at the moment, `docker-pygen` should
work, but lacks the ability to send SIGHUPs and has lesss testing.
